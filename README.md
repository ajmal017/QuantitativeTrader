# Trader

Welcome, in this Repo, you will find two series of frameworks. Live_trading 
and Back_Testing framework.

The back Testing platform is based off of backtraders' infastrucure https://www.backtrader.com
which receives historical stock data with variables declared in test.py . It is named test.py because it is the primary platform that strategies can be built upon.

The live_trading repository allows for the implementation of your developed algorithm into real time.

TO INSTALL ALL THE NECESSARY PACKAGES USE  

    pip install -r requirements.txt 


To see more information, each directory will have a dedicated README.
